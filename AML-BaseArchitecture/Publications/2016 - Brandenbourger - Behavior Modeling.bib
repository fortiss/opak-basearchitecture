abstract={Within the multi-disciplinary engineering process of a cyber-physical production system, the information about the plant is increasing steadily. Different departments work on separate domain-specific models and tools allowing a specialized view of the same system. However, data exchange and linking the heterogeneous information across domains is a critical issue. This paper investigates behavior modeling of automation components out of interdependencies coming from different disciplines such as mechanics, electrics, and software engineering. By this, the interlinking of the domain-specific models, as an enabling step towards early cross-domain validation and facilitated system evolution, allows a common understanding of the correct functionality of the system. The concept will be explained through the example of a pneumatic stopper and evaluated in AutomationML, an emerging standard in automation, to store and exchange artifacts between domain-specific engineering tools.},
