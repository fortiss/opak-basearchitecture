abstract = "Abstract Due to individual customer demands the efficiency of the engineering process becomes more and more important for special purpose machine manufacturers. The engineering process is a cross-domain challenge between mechanics, electrics and software, but a lack of collaboration and information transfer between the domains leads to suboptimal efficiency of engineering. To improve the cross-domain collaboration this paper presents the Manufacturing System Dependency Model (MaSDeM). The basic idea of MaSDeM is to install a cross-domain solution model at the beginning of the engineering process in order to design, discuss and harmonise the principle solution with all participants involved in this project. This solution model is based on partial models, representing the performance specification by the customer, the physical layout and the detailed execution of the manufacturing steps. The partial models and their specific elements are strongly interconnected. The interconnections are realised with dependencies between the elements representing the influence that the elements have on each other. The creation of a network of dependencies provides advanced information on the system and enables the engineer to take profound decisions. This improves the cross-domain collaboration and thereby increases the efficiency of engineering. The benefit of modelling dependencies is related to the effort involved in creating and updating the model. The realisation of MaSDeM in a software tool is therefore presented concentrating on the efficient usability of the tool. "
